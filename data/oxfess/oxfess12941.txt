#oxfess12941  You might not feel guilt. Your friends won't tag me in this. I've had a girlfriend since you cheated on me. But it's taken me this long to process what happened. I know it'll come back to you and I don't forgive you, you'll have to suffer like I did. Enjoy the home I suffered through for you.
