#oxfess14881  I’m trying my best to improve my mental state but I’m finding it both physically and mentally exhausting trying to keep up and be who I want to be.  I smile but I mostly just want to cry. I feel like an actor; when I’m in public it feels like I’m just reading from a scrip. Every encounter feels manufactured. Then when I’m home and out of view, that’s when I get to say ‘cut’. But it leaves me drained.
