#oxfess17431  Massive Oxhate to people that don't reply when you contact them urgently about something important. I don't care, even if you have an essay due now-right-now, it takes literally 10 seconds to say 'Just seen this I'll get back to you later' and frankly it is just common decency not to leave the other person hanging when you can reply in under five minutes. Come on, it's not hard.
