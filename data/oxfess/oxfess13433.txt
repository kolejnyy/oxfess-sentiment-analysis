#oxfess13433  We need more people like that girl at univ  who wears one black superstar and one white superstar (adidas)  If anyone knows her shout her out !! There was a hysterical little boy at cornmarket (he lost his parents) and she got him to calm down, sat with him until he was able to speak (she called his parents i'm guessing) and then bought him some food. Not to be a creeper (I was eating at wasabi)  but it was genuinely heartwarming to see a stranger not hesitate tâ€¦
