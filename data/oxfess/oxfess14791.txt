#oxfess14791  Big Oxlove to Wadham, Univ, Queens and Trinity to have their ball on the same night (sadly didn’t make it to any of these)! First it seemed weird to have so many college balls on the same night, but wow what a view! So many sharp looking people in white and black tie earlier this evening in front of the radcam! That was a quite unique scene, even for Oxford!  Maybe there should be something like an Oxford university ball, and the entire city centre + all college…
