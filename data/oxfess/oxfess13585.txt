#oxfess13585  I can’t start my dphil next year (or for a while, for reasons), so I’m looking for jobs I think that city we always talked about, the one you love so much. I regret how things ended and wish we could have at least stayed friends, but I could tell you weren’t feeling it the last time I messaged you. But you said that maybe one day our paths would cross again…well they’re about to…
