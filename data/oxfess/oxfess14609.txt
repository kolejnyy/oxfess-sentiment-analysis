#oxfess14609  Day in the life of an oxfesser: 10am: wake up, having slept through their first lecture 11am: finish scrolling through oxfess, having commented something either horrifically out of touch or something totally meaningless which they think is the funniest thing ever 11.15: get down to some hard E&Ming. That's right, going to the lib to do no work but just chat over a bag of doritos whilst distracting everyone elseâ€¦
