#oxfess13532  As a bloke I might be missing something here…but does perming your hair really require you to stink up the entire staircase with peroxide so badly that people are getting headaches IN THEIR OWN ROOMS three days later?? And if so, is it so unreasonable to suggest that maybe it’s something that should be done in a professional salon or in your own home, not in a shared bathroom used by 12 people and that now smells so suffocatingly bad that no one else can go in there?
