#oxfess14078  i feel so so shit. i have finals coming up soon and even though i’ve been working 7/8 hours every day, revising, doing past papers, going to tutes, etc, it feels like nothing is actually going in. i sit down to do a paper and remember absolutely nothing. it’s terrifying and idk what i’m doing wrong and i haven’t had a closed book exam since school and i just feel like i’m completely fucked. idk what to do. i keep having mental breakdowns just thinking about sitt…
