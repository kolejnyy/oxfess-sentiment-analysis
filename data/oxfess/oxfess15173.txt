#oxfess15173  @ Oxfess #15158 Allow me to speak on behalf of all pedestrians. Don't plough through zebra crossings and red traffic lights. You are bound to the same road laws as everyone else. A special pinch at Deliveroo, the conoany should be taking responsibility for their dangerous cyclists. It is disgusting.
