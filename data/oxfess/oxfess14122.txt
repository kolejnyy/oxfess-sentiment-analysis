#oxfess14122  finalist here. I've fallen in love once during my degree, but it didnâ€™t work out. I really want to do it again before I leave (also because I'm definitely not getting a first or a blue), and I could really use some crowdsourced wisdom. please comment your suggestions! (people and strategies both welcome.)  n.b.: tories and aspiring tories need not apply.
