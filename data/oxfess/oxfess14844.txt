#oxfess14844  Oxconfused to people who go out of their way to do a covid test (now you have to buy them), test positive and still go to a ball. I havent done a test since Hillary and would turn a blind eye to any sniffles but why buy a test when you're gonna ignore the result? Ball committees should have given a refund to people who could show a positive test though.
