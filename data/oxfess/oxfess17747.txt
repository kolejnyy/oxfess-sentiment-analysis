#oxfess17747  Oxhate to dumbing yourself down and putting on a super cheery act to try and make up for someone’s complete lack of insight or conversational/social skills, and them using it to make themselves feel smart. Like nah mate, stop trying to smugly explain basic concepts to me that I know well. I may put on a ditzy act, but do not mistake my putting you at ease for stupidity.   And oxhate to myself for not firmly putting them right instead of keeping quiet for the sak…
