#oxfess18431  I just skipped a tutorial for the first time in the three years I’ve been here and I feel incredibly guilty. I’m fine with skipping essays and things like that, but I’ve made it a principle to NEVER skip a tutorial because of how little contact hours I have. How do I stop feeling this guilt?
