#oxfess17522  Hi  This time last year, I sent my friends and colleagues an anonymous survey about what they were grateful for in preparation for the holidays. I'm doing the same this year, hoping that I can compare the two years, create some rich multimedia work, and visualise this beautiful data.  I would so appreciate if you could add your responses, and the responses of your friends, colleagues, and family members, to the form below. In my field, data becomes more useful if it comes from more people, and diverse ones too! Thank you so much
