#oxfess13866  Calling cry to any Benetian, young or old: there may not be many of us but we will never be forgotten, silenced or put down. They will try with sweets, bigger college endowments and “student welfare” but Benets is an attitude, a philosophy, a spirit. We may go under but from it we will rise, and like a phoenix, we will burn a blaze in the sky.  FTBCC now, tomorrow and in saecula saeculorum
