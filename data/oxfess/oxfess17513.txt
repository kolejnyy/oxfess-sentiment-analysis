#oxfess17513  Oxhate to St Hugh’s College JCR for their blatant sexist treatment of the only worthy candidate of JCR presidency. Shameless that we still treat women who can assert themselves and actually have a voice this way when we as a college were founded on the basis of educating women and empowering their status as polictical and academic thinkers. you guys are so annoying  also the fact that you can’t even stick your ground because you’re all apologising privately lol
