#oxfess15615  To the Freshers who are introverts/don't want to go clubbing for covid, alcohol or other reasons - I didn't go out at all! Most freshers reps make an effort to have alternatives - if you don't love clubbing you can just as easily meet people then  I feel like most people don't make their friends at clubs anyway - more at pres, in classes, at college bars, societies etc.   tldr Don't feel like you have to do it to make friends - it's a fun thing, but honestly mâ€¦
