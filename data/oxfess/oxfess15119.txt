#oxfess15119  I am from a low-income background, and I have to work through term time to fund myself. This means I lost a lot of social time with people, and also the time for my own study.   BUT I strongly believe that selective education is required. Toning down the selection process based on (usually insufficiently justified) inequality arguments will only result in lower reputation of Oxford. Yes, indeed Oxford has been prestigious, and this will last for quite a long timâ€¦
