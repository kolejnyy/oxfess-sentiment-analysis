#oxfess14868  Magd's Oscar Wilde party was AMAZING. Yeah, we didn't have dodgems or a ferris wheel, but we had free entry, free drinks, free food and great music on the dancefloor. If this is what a free Magd event looks like (and mind you, even if it hadn't been free the tickets would only have been Â£80), imagine what next year's commemoration ball is going to be like  Already planning my fit xx
