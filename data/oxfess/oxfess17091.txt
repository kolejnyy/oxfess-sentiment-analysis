#oxfess17091  Can people please just get over past relationships? I haven't talked to you in 2+ years, you're an irrelevant nothing blip in my life, and you're still here spreading rumours about me and sending your college son around to further spread even wilder rumours like an attack dog on rabies. Move on with life please, daddy's money is nice but don't you actually want to make something of your life? Instead of trying to play the victim all the time, maybe just MOVE TF â€¦
