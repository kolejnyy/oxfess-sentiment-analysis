#oxfess18142  Oxhate to political vultures hijacking a debate, ruining a school visit, bringing the entire union into disrepute and pissing off every single guest invited in one night.

You hacks just crave your two minutes of feeling important and above everyone, pretending that you actually matter in this world before you leave university and live your sad ordinary life.
