#oxfess15381  Oxhate to the welfare rep who’s actively posting about his hatred for the queen and how he couldn’t be happier that she’s dead (in far more vile terms). Take a long, hard look at yourself and have a little respect. A woman has just died and regardless of your personal views people lost their mother today, which no decent human being should ever wish on anyone else. You should be ashamed.
