#oxfess15057  Can anyone recommend a good curly hair hairdresser in Oxford? Also is it worth going to a curly hair salon, I’ve never been? I just go to a local hair dressers back home and spend £20 (every time I’m terrified the hairdresser will freak out with the thickness and ruin my hair). But if it’s worth it, I’m prepared to spend the money.
