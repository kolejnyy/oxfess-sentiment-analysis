#oxfess14972  Does anyone know how much public affairs consultants earn, and how the salary increases from year to year? I'm worried about making sure I earn enough because of the rising cost of living, so I want to find this out, but I feel like it's rude to directly ask people who do that job how much they earn and how quickly they got on that rung of the pay scale
