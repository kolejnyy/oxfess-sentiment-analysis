#oxfess18525  Oxhate to my Biochem Part II project going horribly. Everything i do is smeared with a 'BUT...' and honestly at the start I put it down to just inexperience: I haven't any internship experience. I haven't got any data as I'm struggling STILL to get my proteins to express that I want to study (these goddamn plants). I'm posting this here in the hope that i'm not the only one getting down by the project
