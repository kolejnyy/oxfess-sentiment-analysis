#oxfess14230  So I’m blind, I turned up to my first exam the other day, they pass me my exam paper… “ this isn’t in braille“ they’d just given me the normal exam !!!  After 2 hours of just sitting in isolation the exam admin finally realised getting a full maths exam written up in Braille wasn’t gonna happen in a reasonable amount of time they just said I couldn’t do the exam !!!…
