#oxfess12894  @whoever had a problem with the NUS conference, you do realise we had SU elections recently and turnout was really low? One of the president candidates wanted to disaffiliate from the NUS but they didn't get elected, and we voted directly for the NUS delegates themselves... If you have a problem with the way student unions operate surely it would be better to convince the people you know to vote for change in the elections, rather than moan on oxfess after the fact?       <
