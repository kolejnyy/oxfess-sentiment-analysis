#oxfess18568  Anyone wants to do a tour of graveyards of Oxford? I find them to be eerie but also incredibly tranquil, and a really great break from the exhausting rythm of this place. Most of them are open all the time, and from some of them you can watch people, cars and trains pass by. It almost makes me forget how burnt out I am of being here...
