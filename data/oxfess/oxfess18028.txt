#oxfess18028  Oxhate to the university treating international students like cash cows. Tuition increased by 10 percent for us. 10 percent of 36000 is a lot of money. It's insane. And I'm tired of everyone looking at international students as if we're the richest people on Earth. Some of us are. Some of us are simply not and all of this is just wrong.
