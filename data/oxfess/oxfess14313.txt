#oxfess14313  Who is actually enforcing the no trashing rule and fines? If it's just the proctors and not the police can we not just refuse to give them our identity and book it - and if they try to stop us to defend ourselves? After hearing about the 'lube guy' I think it's best to just get the fuck away from them or 'scatter' if you're in a group.  Like who's patrolling uni parks or whatever  -
