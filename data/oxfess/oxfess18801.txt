#oxfess18801  Oxhate to the guy in the office at the Union today. Took ages to process each request, which wouldnâ€™t be so bad but he was so rude to everyone there! There was an elderly man trying to get his card and he treated him as if he was stupid. He then seemed very irritated with a student whose first language was not English when he asked him for clarification or to repeat himself. In comparison, he was all smiles for the standing committee people! Union is snobby to its core.
