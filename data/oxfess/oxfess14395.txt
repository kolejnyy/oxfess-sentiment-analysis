#oxfess14395  Oxhate to the classics faculty sending so many irrelevant emails to ALL the people on their mailing list and not just the groups they're aimed at. Flooding my inbox w seminars and special lectures for postgrads when I'm literally just a first year undergrad stressing about exams. I'm overwhelmed and anxious as it is and now I've missed a v important email from one of my tutors about work for one of my classes AND missed the deadline for it!!
