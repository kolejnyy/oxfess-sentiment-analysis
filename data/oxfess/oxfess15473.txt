#oxfess15473  To the two kind women who helped me with the aggressive man on Headington Hill on Thursday (15th September), thank you. I donated the money dropped (Â£25) to a charity shop and also donated the same amount from my own pocket to the charity Mind. If the aggressive man was drunk, he ought to think about his actions. If mentally unwell, please seek help.
