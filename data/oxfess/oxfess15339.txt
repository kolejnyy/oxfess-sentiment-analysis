#oxfess15339  Shout out to any postgrads who are finding this process really lonely. I massively struggle working on my own all the time and I get distracted from work all the time thinking about social things. I've tried to make friends and I do know plenty of people in passing, but I feel left out when I see groups have arranged to do things together. Does anyone know what I can do to stay more motivated and not feel this lack of connection so deeply?
