#oxfess15385  With the number of ‘thank you for your service’ I’ve read in honour of queen Elizabeth II, can someone explain to me, what service? What exactly did she do? Don’t say I’m being provocative or that I should know, tell me exactly what she did for you. Im not speaking ill of the dead, im saying nothing about her, I want to know what this ‘service’ was.
