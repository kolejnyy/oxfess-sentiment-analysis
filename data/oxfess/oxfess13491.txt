#oxfess13491  I had no idea some colleges kick people who aren't attending the ball out of their room all night and I'm a 3rd year student (I blame covid). Surely, colleges should give every student not attending the same amount they would charge a student to stay per day outside of official term time,  so the student can afford to stay elsewhere?  I might be misunderstanding something, but colleges would rather have students sleep on the streets than have someone go to a balâ€¦
