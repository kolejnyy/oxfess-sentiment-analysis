#oxfess18715  I hate feeling like a burden to my friends because of my problems. I’m not trying to bring you all down with me but I constantly feel like I’m doing just that, and this is making me even more unhappy. It’s a vicious cycle of sadness and I don’t know how to get out of it, but I love you all and want you to be happy with or without me around. Posting it here bc I need to get it out but can’t find the words to say it straight. I love you, I’m sorry xx
