#oxfess17466  oxhate to my ‘friends’. I don’t know what I have done to deserve this, but it is not ok to be deceitful and mean like this. Not inviting me to a party you are hosting literally NEXT DOOR is cruel. Has made my living situation feel incredibly hostile. If you have a problem with me please grow up and have the decency to say it to my face
