#oxfess14993  A real confession! As a "goody-goody-two-shoes", I used to abhor the idea of urinating in the room sink. Then my life changed forever with the virus. Soon I was a social outcast, banished from the rest of the house. It was either the disgust of walking around as a diseased individual or the shame of using the room sink. I opted for shame.   Yet ever since, I ask whyever do we bother walking to the bathroom? It's also eco-friendly, requiring less water per sessioâ€¦
