#oxfess18936  Jaded finalist here to tell you - the ‘Oxford experience’ is a farce, there is no One Experience you should aim to within this university, it is just what you make of it. Just enjoy freedom from the world of work for a few more years. If that freedom means nights out and drinking, great. If it means nights in reading and watching movies, great. Don’t let it be tainted by worrying about what you think you should be doing.
