#oxfess15397  My parents are £300 over the Crankstart eligibility of £27.5k I've not just lost all the support I was getting, I've also lost my community. I was looking forward to welcoming new freshers from similar backgrounds and escaping Oxford elitism... it's ashame and I need to rant about it so, hello oxfess
