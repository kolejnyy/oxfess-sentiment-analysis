#oxfess17166  As someone with many (not always nice) years of experience in Oxford as an undergraduate, an applicant, a rusticee, and a reject, I’ve decided to make an anon messenger account for all those both in and out of this strange place with questions, doubts, proposals, and fears. I’ll be tagging myself in the comments when this is approved. My pledge is that anything you message me will be answered swiftly and in the strictest confidence, or should you be a bit nervou…
