#oxfess18158  Has anyone else been constantly ill this term?  I've had to ask for two essay extensions already because of it and I feel awful. I can't even rest properly because I feel the weight of the incomplete reading list when I try to, so I end up just trying to push on and making myself more ill as a result.
