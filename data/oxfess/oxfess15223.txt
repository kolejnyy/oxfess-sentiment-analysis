#oxfess15223  shoutout to everyone involved with starting qpoc project oxford - even though it started later into the year, it was so nice to have events with other lgbt+ people of colour, feeling visibly represented, having a judgement-free zone to discuss things with people that could understand all the various religious, cultural, social etc. nuances that come with it.  i was genuinely so surprised with the turnout at some events and i'm so excited to hopefully see it growâ€¦
