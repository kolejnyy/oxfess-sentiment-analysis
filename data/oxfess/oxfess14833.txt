#oxfess14833  Queen's is such a lovely college and 95% of the staff are so welcoming and caring but prospective applicants should be warned of how TRULY nasty and uncaring the bursary and domestic bursary is. To say they have no regard for welfare would be an understatement. It seriously affects mental well being  and in all honesty after everything I've been through during my degree here, I would have chosen another college. You'll never see it mentioned on a prospectus of course.
