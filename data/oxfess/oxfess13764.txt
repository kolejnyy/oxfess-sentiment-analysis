#oxfess13764  (very incomplete) ranking of matcha latte @ oxford:  vaults & garden: probably the best i’ve had at oxford. good vibrant colour. excellent taste (hot or iced) bird & blend: colour is a kind of pale green - either the matcha powder is not fresh enough or there’s too much milk. taste is ok…
