#oxfess13895  Can the person in the Worcester upper library who keeps coughing please stop coming?? I totally understand that you are sick but your very loud and intermittent coughs make the upper library a very disturbing and hard place to study. I'd really appreciate it if you stayed at home and came when you were feeling better
