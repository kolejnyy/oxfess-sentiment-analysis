#oxfess14510  Is there anyone who can fill me in on why St. Benet's Hall is actually closing?  Some 'higher-ups' in the university tell me that there were multiple financial offers to save Benet's which would have meant changing the identity of the Hall. And I understand if a Hall rejects those. You should certainly stay clear of people who are just trying to buy themselves into the Board of Trustees and wish to steer the Hall into a direction incompatible with its founding câ€¦
