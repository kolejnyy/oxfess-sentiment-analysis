#oxfess14161  Is there any way college or exam schools would have put cameras in the bathroom to make sure no one was going in to cheat during finals? Otherwise could people not bring notes or their phones to the loo with them… Do invigilators make sure to confiscate your phone when you are sitting exams in college or in exam schools? Surely taking away your phone should not be allowed due to privacy reasons…
