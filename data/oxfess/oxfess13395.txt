#oxfess13395  Oxfessers I need ur help - Ox Uni Geog Soc need dogs for a walk this Saturday (30th April, 1:30pm, meeting at Worcester College for Port Meadow). We've tried St Catz (doggo is heavily pregnant apparently lol) and ChCh (no luck) so plz contact us via socials if you've got any doggy contacts in Ox - you will be rewarded with free snacks of ur choice and Geog Soc merch (if u want it hehe).
