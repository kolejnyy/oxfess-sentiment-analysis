#oxfess18800  Oxhate to expensive ball tickets. I get that it's expensive to put on events like that but how do you all just have a casual Â£200 to spend on s single night?! Everyone's saying that you need to go because it's part of the "Oxford experience" but it's just impossible for me and it's making me feel really left out. Surely I can't be the only one?!
