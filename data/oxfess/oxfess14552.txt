#oxfess14552  i've written 14 essays this term as a second year humanities student and literally only 3 of them have been good. a) how do i improve and b) how do i stop feeling terrible about it? the pressure of writing a good essay obviously makes me write a worse essay than if i hadn't been self-conscious lol.
