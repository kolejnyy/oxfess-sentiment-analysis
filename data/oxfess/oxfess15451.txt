#oxfess15451  Can anyone recommend a really LGBTQ+ inclusive church in Oxford? Like, one that where as a lesbian you could marry your girlfriend there, and the ministers/leaders wouldn't bat an eyelid if you came out as trans to them? Preferably with music/singing and with services at various times Thank you to any people who respond in advance
