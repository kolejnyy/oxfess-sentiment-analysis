#oxfess18580  Oxhate to the mess in Park kitchen @some. Grow up and clean after yourself. Dishes are lying there for weeks on unclean. Fringes are overflowing. Are you expecting the scouts to wash it or are you waiting for your mummy? I canâ€™t comprehend that 2nd and above year are living there. Take some responsibility and be considerate of others.
