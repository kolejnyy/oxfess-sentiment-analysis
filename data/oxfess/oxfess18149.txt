#oxfess18149  please advise on how to make friends at this stage in the term as a fresher.. i ofc have some friends but it feels like everyone i talk to is mostly within my subject and everyone’s already got their groups by now :(( i’m introverted and don’t like hanging around the bar/jcr much because it’s always way too busy and very intimidating. i’ve also had no time to join socs so far and it seems a bit late at this stage to go along. all help appreciated
