#oxfess14182  to the SPC oxfesser who posted about bar noise, you are so valid, especially during these exam weeks. I'm sorry the replies are so passive aggressively bitchy. People in this college can truly be selfish when it comes to partying. One would think that finalists would be backing you up sympathetically. All the power to you, I'd recommend calling the lodge after 11 and siccing the JDs on the bar.
