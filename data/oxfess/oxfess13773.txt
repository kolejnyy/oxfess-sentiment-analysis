#oxfess13773  Absolutely love how rusticated students who haven't been here for nearly two terms comment on the Facebook JCR page trying to tell people who actually live in college what is what, when those people clearly know what is what (and it's not what the rusticated students think is what), and so are asking stuff on the JCR page because they need *current* students to help find an item, not a rusticated student who last lived on college three terms ago.
