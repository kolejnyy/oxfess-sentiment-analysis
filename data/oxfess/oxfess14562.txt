#oxfess14562  I am a conservative through and through. I bleed Brexit. I have Churchill tattooed on my right ankle (couldn’t be the left one for obvious reasons). So why all the Union hack messages I was sent talk about meeting me at Beer and Bickering is absolutely beyond me. I have never, nor will ever set foot there. That I’m  apparently passing for a radical Corbynista socialist is extremely concerning to me.
