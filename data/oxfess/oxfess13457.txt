#oxfess13457  I would submit a long oxfess detailing what exactly is wrong with my course but who gives a shit (even if the oxfess would go through, colleges as X are more important)  I will graduate in two months and forget about this hellhole, and future generations will still come to study this course here not knowing how absolutely abysmal the quality of teaching is
