#oxfess17098  I've literally never heard of St Peter's before people started posting on here about it. Talking about it because the social life is good or whatever, no one cares or comes to oxford because of that. I don't care if this comes across as condescending, but I wouldn't swap Trinity for St Peter's, so please stop talking about it and trying to make us jealous.
