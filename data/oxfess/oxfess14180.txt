#oxfess14180  guys it’s not a joke anymore. we are getting to the end of the academic year and none of you have had the courage or the audacity to confess your undying love for me. i KNOW you’re all in love with me, how could you not be? i’m literally perfect: kind, caring, drop-dead gorgeous and humble. i’m giving you one last chance before i let loose the bag of snakes i collected from the EM lecture theatres and let them slither round the radcam whilst you’re all revising!…
