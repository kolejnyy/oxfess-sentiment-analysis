#oxfess14051  Stressed PPE (sorry) fresher here, pls help! My econ tutor told us that they can't ask about anything that is not in the lectures in the exam. But the university (and him) set countless book chapters for both micro and marco. I know he's got other things wrong but is this right? If you knew everything they said in the lectures and powerpoints would you know all the content needed? Or can they ask you questions on Jones, Varian and CORE textbook stuff too?
