#oxfess18944  Matched and been speaking to a REALLY cute guy who goes to Oxford at the end of Michaelmas. Been hitting it off and he is really sweet. However, heâ€™s going home for the Vac and lives like 4 hours away, then is going abroad for the last 3 weeks. Question is, do I try and meet him now and go tf out of my way, or do I wait until Hilary and meet him then? But what if it fizzles out? AAAAAHHHHHHH I HATE DATING
