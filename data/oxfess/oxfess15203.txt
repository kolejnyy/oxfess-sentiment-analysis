#oxfess15203  The Taylor Swift community at Oxford is so confusing to me. She dated a 17 year old when she was 20, an 18 year old when she was 23. Her Carbon Footprint makes me physically ill, defending it by saying she rents her plane out to other people is the worst denial I’ve ever seen people in. She stayed silent when white nationalist groups dubbed her their queen. The list goes on.  Don’t get me wrong, she has had horrible things happen to her and I am in no way trying…
