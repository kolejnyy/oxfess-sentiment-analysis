#oxfess14504  Yes I get it, some of you guys have finished your exams so well done for that and I’m sure you did well! But not everyone has finished yet, so just like how WE’VE BEEN QUIET FOR YOU, I expect the same in return for the next few weeks - just be quiet, it’s not that hard to just keep your mouth shut when it gets dark out… I just want to sleep properly without having to wake up to hollering and yelling.
