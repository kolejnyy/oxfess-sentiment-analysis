#oxfess18148  fresher here. just got my lecture lists for the next two terms and they get increasingly empty. is being terrified because of that a reasonable response? i feel like the amount of tutorials i'm gonna end up having will swamp me with work i can't keep up with. i might well be fine but this is my first reaction. is this normal?
