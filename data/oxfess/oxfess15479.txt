#oxfess15479  I’m not surprised by humsoc’s decision to make Diwali ball alcohol free considering how exclusive they are as a society. Since first year I’ve found that their events only ever catered to ultra religious Hindus and never that keen on sharing that space with more secular or cultural Hindus… Diwali is culture for so many south Asians, not just the Hindu extremists. I hope that the committee please consider this.
