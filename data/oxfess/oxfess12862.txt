#oxfess12862  i spent weeks getting over you at the start of hilary and now that  term's ended you pop back into my life and make me question everything again... i literally cannot stop thinking about you even though we can't be together. why are you so fucking irresistible and why do i play back every moment with you at 4am in the morning when i know you're still awake ???
