#oxfess18701  What went wrong with the 93% club ball? Paid Â£40 and only got one drink at the bar before they stopped accepting the tokens they had given us, meaning we had to pay extra for their expensive drinks, and food wasn't free either. For a party designed for state school students, not everyone is going to have enough money to spend extra on top of the already fairly pricey entry ticket. I don't know why this happened but it was honestly a big disappointment for a lot of people there
