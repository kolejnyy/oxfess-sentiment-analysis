#oxfess18281  Is Keble turning off the heating in halls at night!?! I have woken up freezing for several nights and my radiator has been ice cold despite being fully on, and then the next morning it’s miraculously producing heat again…several others living in Haywood and DB accom have said the same… They may be Turing it off to save money but we live in single glazed glass boxes. No wonder so many people are coming down with chest infections.
