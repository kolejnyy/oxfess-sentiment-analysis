#oxfess18323  Honestly the anti homeless rhetoric in the union doesn’t surprise me.  The ex CCC from St John’s ran for SU president pledging a ‘campaign against the homeless’ and all the hacks supported him. He only got defeated because regular people on Oxfess called him out and did the right thing.
