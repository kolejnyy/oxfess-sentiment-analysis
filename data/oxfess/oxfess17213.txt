#oxfess17213  Let‘s all face the truth: doing a masters at Oxford is no sign of academic excellence. These programmes are the cash cows of the uni and the acceptance rate is higher than at my local primary school. Unless you‘re done your undergrad or dphil here please stop pretending that you‘re exceptional students
