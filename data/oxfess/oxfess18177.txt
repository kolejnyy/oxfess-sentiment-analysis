#oxfess18177  Oxdisappointed to RAG ball... Great for a few hours but a ball costing over Â£100 to be closed by midnight?! Embarrassing! I expected to be there many hours into the morning at that price. Genuinely angry. Was great as I said for a while but ended far far too early for such an expensive ball.
