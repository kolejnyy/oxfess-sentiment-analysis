#oxfess17171  I woke up this morning to the sound of dripping..I assumed it would be a running tap, but it wasn’t- I was confused. I was walking around my room to try and find the source, and then I notice that there’s a puddle on my textbook on my desk…I’m leaning over the textbook just thinking wtf!?? Then something drips on the back of my head..I look up at my shelf…There is a sagging, moldy pumpkin oozing disgusting pumpkin juice!!! I had freaking rancid pumpkin juice all…
