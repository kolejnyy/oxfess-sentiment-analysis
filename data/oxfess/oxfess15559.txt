#oxfess15559  Hi, I doubt this will get to you but I want to apologise. Not sure exactly what I said but I know I was jealous and insecure and all round had been pretty crappy to you. It's not fair for me to put blame on you when you had no mal intent. It is hard seeing you thrive while I spiral and I'm grateful for when you let me join in in that happiness. But I'm also sorry for bringing you down and expecting you to be sad
