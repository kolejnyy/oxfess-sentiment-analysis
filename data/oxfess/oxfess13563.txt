#oxfess13563  one of my friends here literally prepares every meal for his girlfriend and washes up every single time as well - I have literally never even seen her set foot in the kitchen. I think it’s a really weird dynamic (she doesn’t clean or help out around the house other ways) but curious to see whether I’m being irrational and it’s actually cute/normal?
