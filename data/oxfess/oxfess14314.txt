#oxfess14314  Had the top 40 on today and .....  Are people incapable of making new music now or something?  The odd throw back sure, gibe it a new lease of life, great But the amount of music thats just old with a new lick of paint but not acc that different, of old just as background to some shitty rap that doesnt even mix well?? â€¦
