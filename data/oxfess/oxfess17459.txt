#oxfess17459  thank you for saying bless you the first time, but please spare me saying it again when I sneeze for the second time, and the third... I know my makeup is streaming down my face and I look like death, but Lord knows Oxford doesn't allow us the liberties of taking a few days off every time a new cold goes round. do the kind thing and pretend you can't see me
