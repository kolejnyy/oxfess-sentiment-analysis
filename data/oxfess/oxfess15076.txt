#oxfess15076  hi! directed at everyone that complains that people w/ short-term degrees don’t “know” oxford as a place: i grew up here and did undergrad and postgrad here - none of you “know” the city well enough to gatekeep so for goodness’ sake chill out. everyone makes what they make of the city so have some decorum and don’t act so superior  xx
