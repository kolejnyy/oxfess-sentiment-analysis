#oxfess18624  Is it worth trying to get an ADHD diagnosis so I can get support from the uni? Like it's definitely impacting my work at this point but also I've heard it takes forever and I'd probably be graduated by then anyway, also I'm worried that having that label over my head for the rest of time might not be the best thing ever...
