#oxfess15305  I'm an incoming fresher and was wondering if anyone could help me out with a quick question as I'm confused by the website: is it possible to get just a swim membership at the Iffley pool? I don't really want to pay Â£280 and get all the excess stuff I'm not going to use... Or if theres a cheaper option elsewhere as I want to keep up my pool swimming but it all seems a bit too confusing
