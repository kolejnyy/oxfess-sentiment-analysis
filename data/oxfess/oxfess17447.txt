#oxfess17447  Could my college - staff and JCR - please shut up about the Sheikh Family Scholarship?! I'm now uncomfortably aware that it awards up to Â£10k a year for a first year UK-based Muslim student, and includes involvement in a mentorship program, and a guaranteed paid summer internship. Those words plague my dreams.
